CHARM: Cross-Cultural Harmonious Communication Multi-Modal Analysis via Norms and Emotion

## Overview

Communication between people from different cultures can be challenging due to a lack of understanding about the norms of another culture or the degree of emotion typically conveyed. As a result, communication failure is a dire risk for such interactions. In this work, we propose a new paradigm for understanding and guiding human communication through detecting norm occurrences, emotional cues, and change-points in conversations using multimedia signals. In particular, we present a framework for cross-cultural harmonious communication multi-modal analysis using norms and emotions (CHARM), and show how each component achieves promising results on new tasks. We conclude by envisioning how CHARM can be used as a cultural interpreter for real-world human interactions.
